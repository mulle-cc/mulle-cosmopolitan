DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of ffiinndd.  GNU ffiinndd searches the directory tree rooted at each given
       starting-point by evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the rules of precedence  (see
       section OPERATORS), until the outcome is known (the left hand side is false for _a_n_d operations, true for _o_r), at
       which point ffiinndd moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-point is specified, `.' is assumed.

       If you are using ffiinndd in an environment where security is important (for example if you are using it  to  search
       directories  that  are  writable  by  other users), you should read the `Security Considerations' chapter of the
       findutils documentation, which is called FFiinnddiinngg FFiilleess and comes with findutils.  That document also includes  a
       lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so you may find it a more useful source of information.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The  --HH,  --LL and --PP options control the treatment of symbolic links.  Command-line arguments following these are
       taken to be names of files or directories to be examined, up to the first argument that begins with `-', or  the
       argument  `('  or `!'.  That argument and any following arguments are taken to be the expression describing what
       is to be searched for.  If no paths are given, the current directory is used.  If no expression  is  given,  the
       expression --pprriinntt is used (but you should probably consider using --pprriinntt00 instead, anyway).

       This  manual page talks about `options' within the expression list.  These options control the behaviour of ffiinndd
       but are specified immediately after the last path name.  The five `real' options --HH, --LL, --PP, --DD and --OO must  ap‐
       pear before the first path name, if at all.  A double dash ---- could theoretically be used to signal that any re‐
       maining arguments are not options, but this does not really work due to the way ffiinndd determines the end  of  the
       following  path  arguments: it does that by reading until an expression argument comes (which also starts with a
       `-').  Now, if a path argument would start with a `-', then ffiinndd would treat it as expression argument  instead.
       Thus,  to  ensure  that all start points are taken as such, and especially to prevent that wildcard patterns ex‐
       panded by the calling shell are not mistakenly treated as expression arguments, it is generally safer to  prefix
       wildcards or dubious path names with either `./' or to use absolute path names starting with '/'.

       -P     Never  follow  symbolic  links.  This is the default behaviour.  When ffiinndd examines or prints information
              about files, and the file is a symbolic link, the information used shall be taken from the properties  of
              the symbolic link itself.

       -L     Follow  symbolic links.  When ffiinndd examines or prints information about files, the information used shall
              be taken from the properties of the file to which the link points, not from the link itself (unless it is
              a  broken symbolic link or ffiinndd is unable to examine the file to which the link points).  Use of this op‐
              tion implies --nnoolleeaaff.  If you later use the --PP option, --nnoolleeaaff will still be in effect.  If --LL is in  ef‐
              fect  and ffiinndd discovers a symbolic link to a subdirectory during its search, the subdirectory pointed to
              by the symbolic link will be searched.

              When the --LL option is in effect, the --ttyyppee predicate will always match against the type of the file  that
              a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself (unless the symbolic link is broken).  Actions that
              can cause symbolic links to become broken while ffiinndd is executing (for example --ddeelleettee) can give rise  to
              confusing behaviour.  Using --LL causes the --llnnaammee and --iillnnaammee predicates always to return false.

       -H     Do  not follow symbolic links, except while processing the command line arguments.  When ffiinndd examines or
              prints information about files, the information used shall be taken from the properties of  the  symbolic
              link itself.  The only exception to this behaviour is when a file specified on the command line is a sym‐
              bolic link, and the link can be resolved.  For that situation, the information used is taken  from  what‐
              ever  the  link points to (that is, the link is followed).  The information about the link itself is used
              as a fallback if the file pointed to by the symbolic link cannot be examined.  If --HH is in effect and one
              of the paths specified on the command line is a symbolic link to a directory, the contents of that direc‐
              tory will be examined (though of course --mmaaxxddeepptthh 00 would prevent this).

       If more than one of --HH, --LL and --PP is specified, each overrides the others; the last one appearing on the command
       line takes effect.  Since it is the default, the --PP option should be considered to be in effect unless either --HH
       or --LL is specified.

       GNU ffiinndd frequently stats files during the processing of the command line itself, before any searching  has  be‐
       gun.   These  options  also affect how those arguments are processed.  Specifically, there are a number of tests
       that compare files listed on the command line against a file we are currently considering.  In  each  case,  the
       file  specified on the command line will have been examined and some of its properties will have been saved.  If
       the named file is in fact a symbolic link, and the --PP option is in effect (or if neither --HH nor --LL  were  speci‐
       fied),  the  information used for the comparison will be taken from the properties of the symbolic link.  Other‐
       wise, it will be taken from the properties of the file the link points to.  If ffiinndd cannot follow the link  (for
       example  because  it has insufficient privileges or the link points to a nonexistent file) the properties of the
       link itself will be used.

       When the --HH or --LL options are in effect, any symbolic links listed as the argument of --nneewweerr  will  be  derefer‐
       enced,  and the timestamp will be taken from the file to which the symbolic link points.  The same consideration
       applies to --nneewweerrXXYY, --aanneewweerr and --ccnneewweerr.

       The --ffoollllooww option has a similar effect to --LL, though it takes effect at the point where it appears (that is, if
       --LL  is  not used but --ffoollllooww is, any symbolic links appearing after --ffoollllooww on the command line will be derefer‐
       enced, and those before it will not).

       -D debugopts
              Print diagnostic information; this can be helpful to diagnose problems with why ffiinndd is  not  doing  what
              you  want.   The  list of debug options should be comma separated.  Compatibility of the debug options is
              not guaranteed between releases of findutils.  For a complete list of valid debug options, see the output
              of ffiinndd --DD hheellpp.  Valid debug options include

              exec   Show diagnostic information relating to -exec, -execdir, -ok and -okdir

              opt    Prints  diagnostic information relating to the optimisation of the expression tree; see the -O op‐
                     tion.

       -Olevel
              Enables  query  optimisation.  The ffiinndd program reorders tests to speed up execution while preserving the
              overall effect; that is, predicates with side effects are not reordered relative to each other.  The  op‐
              timisations performed at each optimisation level are as follows.

              0      Equivalent to optimisation level 1.

              1      This  is the default optimisation level and corresponds to the traditional behaviour.  Expressions
                     are reordered so that tests based only on the names of files (for example --nnaammee  and  --rreeggeexx)  are
                     performed first.

              2      Any  --ttyyppee or --xxttyyppee tests are performed after any tests based only on the names of files, but be‐
                     fore any tests that require information from the inode.  On many modern  versions  of  Unix,  file
                     types  are  returned  by  rreeaaddddiirr(()) and so these predicates are faster to evaluate than predicates
                     which need to stat the file first.  If you use the --ffssttyyppee _F_O_O predicate and specify a  filesystem
                     type _F_O_O which is not known (that is, present in `/etc/mtab') at the time ffiinndd starts, that predi‐
                     cate is equivalent to --ffaallssee.

              3      At this optimisation level, the full cost-based query optimiser is enabled.  The order of tests is
                     modified so that cheap (i.e. fast) tests are performed first and more expensive ones are performed
                     later, if necessary.  Within each cost band, predicates are evaluated earlier or  later  according
                     to  whether they are likely to succeed or not.  For --oo, predicates which are likely to succeed are
                     evaluated earlier, and for --aa, predicates which are likely to fail are evaluated earlier.

              The cost-based optimiser has a fixed idea of how likely any given test is to succeed.  In some cases  the
              probability  takes account of the specific nature of the test (for example, --ttyyppee ff is assumed to be more
              likely to succeed than --ttyyppee cc).  The cost-based optimiser is currently being evaluated.  If it does  not
              actually improve the performance of ffiinndd, it will be removed again.  Conversely, optimisations that prove
              to be reliable, robust and effective may be enabled at lower optimisation levels over time.  However, the
              default behaviour (i.e. optimisation level 1) will not be changed in the 4.3.x release series.  The find‐
              utils test suite runs all the tests on ffiinndd at each optimisation level and ensures that the result is the
              same.

EEXXPPRREESSSSIIOONN
       The part of the command line after the list of starting points is the _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n.  This is a kind of query spec‐
       ification describing how we match files and what we do with the files that were matched.  An expression is  com‐
       posed of a sequence of things:

       Tests  Tests  return  a true or false value, usually on the basis of some property of a file we are considering.
              The --eemmppttyy test for example is true only when the current file is empty.

       Actions
              Actions have side effects (such as printing something on the standard output) and return either  true  or
              false,  usually  based  on  whether or not they are successful.  The --pprriinntt action for example prints the
              name of the current file on the standard output.

       Global options
              Global options affect the operation of tests and actions specified on  any  part  of  the  command  line.
              Global  options always return true.  The --ddeepptthh option for example makes ffiinndd traverse the file system in
              a depth-first order.

       Positional options
              Positional options affect only tests or actions which follow  them.   Positional  options  always  return
              true.   The  --rreeggeexxttyyppee  option  for example is positional, specifying the regular expression dialect for
              regular expressions occurring later on the command line.

       Operators
              Operators join together the other items within the expression.  They include for example --oo (meaning log‐
              ical OR) and --aa (meaning logical AND).  Where an operator is missing, --aa is assumed.

       The --pprriinntt action is performed on all files for which the whole expression is true, unless it contains an action
       other than --pprruunnee or --qquuiitt.  Actions which inhibit the default --pprriinntt are --ddeelleettee, --eexxeecc, --eexxeeccddiirr, --ookk, --ookkddiirr,
       --ffllss, --ffpprriinntt, --ffpprriinnttff, --llss, --pprriinntt and --pprriinnttff.

       The --ddeelleettee action also acts like an option (since it implies --ddeepptthh).

   PPOOSSIITTIIOONNAALL OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Positional options always return true.  They affect only tests occurring later on the command line.

       -daystart
              Measure  times  (for  --aammiinn, --aattiimmee, --ccmmiinn, --ccttiimmee, --mmmmiinn, and --mmttiimmee) from the beginning of today rather
              than from 24 hours ago.  This option only affects tests which appear later on the command line.

       -follow
              Deprecated; use the --LL option instead.  Dereference symbolic links.  Implies --nnoolleeaaff.  The --ffoollllooww option
              affects  only those tests which appear after it on the command line.  Unless the --HH or --LL option has been
              specified, the position of the --ffoollllooww option changes the behaviour of the --nneewweerr  predicate;  any  files
              listed as the argument of --nneewweerr will be dereferenced if they are symbolic links.  The same consideration
              applies to --nneewweerrXXYY, --aanneewweerr and --ccnneewweerr.  Similarly, the --ttyyppee predicate will always match  against  the
              type  of  the  file that a symbolic link points to rather than the link itself.  Using --ffoollllooww causes the
              --llnnaammee aanndd --iillnnaammee predicates always to return false.

       -regextype _t_y_p_e
              Changes the regular expression syntax understood by --rreeggeexx and --iirreeggeexx tests which  occur  later  on  the
              command  line.   To see which regular expression types are known, use --rreeggeexxttyyppee hheellpp.  The Texinfo docu‐
              mentation (see SSEEEE AALLSSOO) explains the meaning of and differences between the various types of regular ex‐
              pression.

       -warn, -nowarn
              Turn  warning messages on or off.  These warnings apply only to the command line usage, not to any condi‐
              tions that ffiinndd might encounter when it searches directories.  The default behaviour corresponds to --wwaarrnn
              if  standard input is a tty, and to --nnoowwaarrnn otherwise.  If a warning message relating to command-line us‐
              age is produced, the exit status of ffiinndd is not affected.  If the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable is
              set, and --wwaarrnn is also used, it is not specified which, if any, warnings will be active.

   GGLLOOBBAALL OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       Global options always return true.  Global options take effect even for tests which occur earlier on the command
       line.  To prevent confusion, global options should specified on the command-line after the list of start points,
       just  before  the  first test, positional option or action.  If you specify a global option in some other place,
       ffiinndd will issue a warning message explaining that this can be confusing.

       The global options occur after the list of start points, and so are not the same kind of option as --LL, for exam‐
       ple.

       -d     A synonym for -depth, for compatibility with FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and OpenBSD.

       -depth Process each directory's contents before the directory itself.  The -delete action also implies --ddeepptthh.

       -help, --help
              Print a summary of the command-line usage of ffiinndd and exit.

       -ignore_readdir_race
              Normally,  ffiinndd  will  emit an error message when it fails to stat a file.  If you give this option and a
              file is deleted between the time ffiinndd reads the name of the file from the directory and the time it tries
              to stat the file, no error message will be issued.  This also applies to files or directories whose names
              are given on the command line.  This option takes effect at the time the  command  line  is  read,  which
              means  that you cannot search one part of the filesystem with this option on and part of it with this op‐
              tion off (if you need to do that, you will need to issue two ffiinndd commands instead, one with  the  option
              and one without it).

              Furthermore,  ffiinndd  with  the --iiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee option will ignore errors of the --ddeelleettee action in the
              case the file has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it will not output an  error  diagnos‐
              tic, and the return code of the --ddeelleettee action will be true.

       -maxdepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
              Descend  at  most _l_e_v_e_l_s (a non-negative integer) levels of directories below the starting-points.  Using
              --mmaaxxddeepptthh 00 means only apply the tests and actions to the starting-points themselves.

       -mindepth _l_e_v_e_l_s
              Do not apply any tests or actions at levels less than _l_e_v_e_l_s (a non-negative integer).  Using --mmiinnddeepptthh 11
              means process all files except the starting-points.

       -mount Don't descend directories on other filesystems.  An alternate name for --xxddeevv, for compatibility with some
              other versions of ffiinndd.

       -noignore_readdir_race
              Turns off the effect of --iiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee.

       -noleaf
              Do not optimize by assuming that directories contain 2 fewer subdirectories than their hard  link  count.
              This  option  is needed when searching filesystems that do not follow the Unix directory-link convention,
              such as CD-ROM or MS-DOS filesystems or AFS volume  mount  points.   Each  directory  on  a  normal  Unix
              filesystem  has  at least 2 hard links: its name and its `.' entry.  Additionally, its subdirectories (if
              any) each have a `..' entry linked to that directory.  When ffiinndd is examining a directory, after  it  has
              statted  2 fewer subdirectories than the directory's link count, it knows that the rest of the entries in
              the directory are non-directories (`leaf' files in the directory tree).  If only the files' names need to
              be examined, there is no need to stat them; this gives a significant increase in search speed.

   TTEESSTTSS
       Some  tests,  for example --nneewweerrXXYY and --ssaammeeffiillee, allow comparison between the file currently being examined and
       some reference file specified on the command line.  When these tests are used, the interpretation of the  refer‐
       ence  file  is  determined by the options --HH, --LL and --PP and any previous --ffoollllooww, but the reference file is only
       examined once, at the time the command line is parsed.  If the reference file cannot be examined  (for  example,
       the ssttaatt(2) system call fails for it), an error message is issued, and ffiinndd exits with a nonzero status.

       A  numeric argument _n can be specified to tests (like --aammiinn, --mmttiimmee, --ggiidd, --iinnuumm, --lliinnkkss, --ssiizzee, --uuiidd and --uusseedd)
       as

       _+_n     for greater than _n,

       _-_n     for less than _n,

       _n      for exactly _n.

       Supported tests:

       -amin _n
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly _n minutes ago.

       -anewer _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              Time of the last access of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification of the
              _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e  file.   If  _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is a symbolic link and the --HH option or the --LL option is in effect, then
              the time of the last data modification of the file it points to is always used.

       -atime _n
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly _n*24 hours ago.  When find figures  out  how  many
              24-hour  periods ago the file was last accessed, any fractional part is ignored, so to match --aattiimmee ++11, a
              file has to have been accessed at least _t_w_o days ago.

       -cmin _n
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly _n minutes ago.

       -cnewer _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              Time of the last status change of the current file is more recent than that of the last data modification
              of  the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e file.  If _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is a symbolic link and the --HH option or the --LL option is in effect,
              then the time of the last data modification of the file it points to is always used.

       -ctime _n
              File's status was last changed less than, more than or exactly _n*24 hours  ago.   See  the  comments  for
              --aattiimmee to understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file status change times.

       -empty File is empty and is either a regular file or a directory.

       -executable
              Matches files which are executable and directories which are searchable (in a file name resolution sense)
              by the current user.  This takes into account access control lists and other permissions artefacts  which
              the  --ppeerrmm  test  ignores.  This test makes use of the aacccceessss(2) system call, and so can be fooled by NFS
              servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems implement aacccceessss(2) in the  client's
              kernel  and  so  cannot make use of the UID mapping information held on the server.  Because this test is
              based only on the result of the aacccceessss(2) system call, there is no guarantee that a file for  which  this
              test succeeds can actually be executed.

       -false Always false.

       -fstype _t_y_p_e
              File  is on a filesystem of type _t_y_p_e.  The valid filesystem types vary among different versions of Unix;
              an incomplete list of filesystem types that are accepted on some version of Unix or another is: ufs, 4.2,
              4.3,  nfs,  tmp,  mfs,  S51K,  S52K.   You can use --pprriinnttff with the %F directive to see the types of your
              filesystems.

       -gid _n File's numeric group ID is less than, more than or exactly _n.

       -group _g_n_a_m_e
              File belongs to group _g_n_a_m_e (numeric group ID allowed).

       -ilname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like --llnnaammee, but the match is case insensitive.  If the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww  option  is  in  effect,
              this test returns false unless the symbolic link is broken.

       -iname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like  --nnaammee, but the match is case insensitive.  For example, the patterns `fo*' and `F??' match the file
              names `Foo', `FOO', `foo', `fOo', etc.  The pattern `*foo*` will also match a file called '.foobar'.

       -inum _n
              File has inode number smaller than, greater than or exactly _n.  It is normally easier to use  the  --ssaammee‐‐
              ffiillee test instead.

       -ipath _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like --ppaatthh.  but the match is case insensitive.

       -iregex _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Like --rreeggeexx, but the match is case insensitive.

       -iwholename _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              See -ipath.  This alternative is less portable than --iippaatthh.

       -links _n
              File has less than, more than or exactly _n hard links.

       -lname _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              File  is a symbolic link whose contents match shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The metacharacters do not treat `/'
              or `.' specially.  If the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww option is in effect, this test  returns  false  unless
              the symbolic link is broken.

       -mmin _n
              File's data was last modified less than, more than or exactly _n minutes ago.

       -mtime _n
              File's  data  was  last  modified  less  than, more than or exactly _n*24 hours ago.  See the comments for
              --aattiimmee to understand how rounding affects the interpretation of file modification times.

       -name _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Base of file name (the path with the leading directories removed) matches shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Because
              the  leading directories are removed, the file names considered for a match with --nnaammee will never include
              a slash, so `-name a/b' will never match anything (you probably need to use --ppaatthh instead).  A warning is
              issued if you try to do this, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.  The metacharacters
              (`*', `?', and `[]') match a `.' at the start of the base name (this is a change in findutils-4.2.2;  see
              section  STANDARDS  CONFORMANCE  below).  To ignore a directory and the files under it, use --pprruunnee rather
              than checking every file in the tree; see an example in the description of that action.  Braces  are  not
              recognised as being special, despite the fact that some shells including Bash imbue braces with a special
              meaning in shell patterns.  The filename matching is performed with the use  of  the  ffnnmmaattcchh(3)  library
              function.   Don't  forget  to  enclose the pattern in quotes in order to protect it from expansion by the
              shell.

       -newer _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              Time of the last data modification of the current file is more recent than that of the last data  modifi‐
              cation  of  the _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e file.  If _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is a symbolic link and the --HH option or the --LL option is in
              effect, then the time of the last data modification of the file it points to is always used.

       -newerXY _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              Succeeds if timestamp _X of the file being considered is newer than timestamp _Y  of  the  file  _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e.
              The letters _X and _Y can be any of the following letters:

              a   The access time of the file _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              B   The birth time of the file _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              c   The inode status change time of _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              m   The modification time of the file _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e
              t   _r_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e is interpreted directly as a time

              Some  combinations  are invalid; for example, it is invalid for _X to be _t.  Some combinations are not im‐
              plemented on all systems; for example _B is not supported on all systems.  If an  invalid  or  unsupported
              combination  of  _X_Y  is specified, a fatal error results.  Time specifications are interpreted as for the
              argument to the --dd option of GNU ddaattee.  If you try to use the birth time of a  reference  file,  and  the
              birth  time  cannot  be determined, a fatal error message results.  If you specify a test which refers to
              the birth time of files being examined, this test will fail for any files where the  birth  time  is  un‐
              known.

       -nogroup
              No group corresponds to file's numeric group ID.

       -nouser
              No user corresponds to file's numeric user ID.

       -path _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              File  name  matches shell pattern _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  The metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.' specially; so, for
              example,
                  find . -path "./sr*sc"
              will print an entry for a directory called _._/_s_r_c_/_m_i_s_c (if one exists).  To ignore a whole directory tree,
              use  --pprruunnee rather than checking every file in the tree.  Note that the pattern match test applies to the
              whole file name, starting from one of the start points named on the command line.   It  would  only  make
              sense to use an absolute path name here if the relevant start point is also an absolute path.  This means
              that this command will never match anything:
                  find bar -path /foo/bar/myfile -print
              Find compares the --ppaatthh argument with the concatenation of a directory name and the base name of the file
              it's  examining.   Since the concatenation will never end with a slash, --ppaatthh arguments ending in a slash
              will match nothing (except perhaps a start point specified on the command line).  The predicate --ppaatthh  is
              also supported by HP-UX ffiinndd and is part of the POSIX 2008 standard.

       -perm _m_o_d_e
              File's  permission  bits  are exactly _m_o_d_e (octal or symbolic).  Since an exact match is required, if you
              want to use this form for symbolic modes, you may have to specify a rather complex mode string.  For  ex‐
              ample `-perm g=w' will only match files which have mode 0020 (that is, ones for which group write permis‐
              sion is the only permission set).  It is more likely that you will want to use the `/' or `-' forms,  for
              example  `-perm  -g=w', which matches any file with group write permission.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for
              some illustrative examples.

       -perm -_m_o_d_e
              All of the permission bits _m_o_d_e are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted in this form, and this
              is  usually  the  way in which you would want to use them.  You must specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a
              symbolic mode.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for some illustrative examples.

       -perm /_m_o_d_e
              Any of the permission bits _m_o_d_e are set for the file.  Symbolic modes are accepted  in  this  form.   You
              must  specify `u', `g' or `o' if you use a symbolic mode.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for some illustrative
              examples.  If no permission bits in _m_o_d_e are set, this test matches any file (the idea here is to be con‐
              sistent with the behaviour of --ppeerrmm --000000).

       -perm +_m_o_d_e
              This is no longer supported (and has been deprecated since 2005).  Use --ppeerrmm //_m_o_d_e instead.

       -readable
              Matches  files  which are readable by the current user.  This takes into account access control lists and
              other permissions artefacts which the --ppeerrmm test ignores.  This test makes use of  the  aacccceessss(2)  system
              call,  and  so  can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems
              implement aacccceessss(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held  on
              the server.

       -regex _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              File  name matches regular expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  This is a match on the whole path, not a search.  For ex‐
              ample, to match a file named _._/_f_u_b_a_r_3_, you can use the regular expression `.*bar.' or `.*b.*3',  but  not
              `f.*r3'.   The  regular  expressions  understood by ffiinndd are by default Emacs Regular Expressions (except
              that `.' matches newline), but this can be changed with the --rreeggeexxttyyppee option.

       -samefile _n_a_m_e
              File refers to the same inode as _n_a_m_e.  When --LL is in effect, this can include symbolic links.

       -size _n[cwbkMG]
              File uses less than, more than or exactly _n units of space, rounding up.  The following suffixes  can  be
              used:

              `b'    for 512-byte blocks (this is the default if no suffix is used)

              `c'    for bytes

              `w'    for two-byte words

              `k'    for kibibytes (KiB, units of 1024 bytes)

              `M'    for mebibytes (MiB, units of 1024 * 1024 = 1048576 bytes)

              `G'    for gibibytes (GiB, units of 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1073741824 bytes)

              The  size  is  simply the st_size member of the struct stat populated by the lstat (or stat) system call,
              rounded up as shown above.  In other words, it's consistent with the result you get for llss --ll.   Bear  in
              mind that the `%k' and `%b' format specifiers of --pprriinnttff handle sparse files differently.  The `b' suffix
              always denotes 512-byte blocks and never 1024-byte blocks, which is different to the behaviour of --llss.

              The + and - prefixes signify greater than and less than, as usual; i.e., an exact size of  _n  units  does
              not match.  Bear in mind that the size is rounded up to the next unit.  Therefore --ssiizzee --11MM is not equiv‐
              alent to --ssiizzee --11004488557766cc.  The former only matches empty files,  the  latter  matches  files  from  0  to
              1,048,575 bytes.

       -true  Always true.

       -type _c
              File is of type _c:

              b      block (buffered) special

              c      character (unbuffered) special

              d      directory

              p      named pipe (FIFO)

              f      regular file

              l      symbolic  link; this is never true if the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww option is in effect, unless the
                     symbolic link is broken.  If you want to search for symbolic links  when  --LL  is  in  effect,  use
                     --xxttyyppee.

              s      socket

              D      door (Solaris)

              To search for more than one type at once, you can supply the combined list of type letters separated by a
              comma `,' (GNU extension).

       -uid _n File's numeric user ID is less than, more than or exactly _n.

       -used _n
              File was last accessed less than, more than or exactly _n days after its status was last changed.

       -user _u_n_a_m_e
              File is owned by user _u_n_a_m_e (numeric user ID allowed).

       -wholename _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              See -path.  This alternative is less portable than --ppaatthh.

       -writable
              Matches files which are writable by the current user.  This takes into account access control  lists  and
              other  permissions  artefacts  which the --ppeerrmm test ignores.  This test makes use of the aacccceessss(2) system
              call, and so can be fooled by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing),  since  many  systems
              implement  aacccceessss(2) in the client's kernel and so cannot make use of the UID mapping information held on
              the server.

       -xtype _c
              The same as --ttyyppee unless the file is a symbolic link.  For symbolic links: if the --HH  or  --PP  option  was
              specified,  true if the file is a link to a file of type _c; if the --LL option has been given, true if _c is
              `l'.  In other words, for symbolic links, --xxttyyppee checks the type of the file that --ttyyppee does not check.

       -context _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              (SELinux only) Security context of the file matches glob _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

       -delete
              Delete files; true if removal succeeded.  If the removal failed, an error message is issued.  If  --ddeelleettee
              fails, ffiinndd's exit status will be nonzero (when it eventually exits).  Use of --ddeelleettee automatically turns
              on the `--ddeepptthh' option.

              WWaarrnniinnggss: Don't forget that the find command line is evaluated as an expression, so putting --ddeelleettee first
              will  make  ffiinndd  try  to delete everything below the starting points you specified.  When testing a ffiinndd
              command line that you later intend to use with --ddeelleettee, you should explicitly specify --ddeepptthh in order  to
              avoid  later  surprises.   Because --ddeelleettee implies --ddeepptthh, you cannot usefully use --pprruunnee and --ddeelleettee to‐
              gether.

              Together with the --iiggnnoorree__rreeaaddddiirr__rraaccee option, ffiinndd will ignore errors of the --ddeelleettee action in the  case
              the file has disappeared since the parent directory was read: it will not output an error diagnostic, and
              the return code of the --ddeelleettee action will be true.

       -exec _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d; true if 0 status is returned.  All following arguments to ffiinndd are taken to be arguments
              to  the  command  until an argument consisting of `;' is encountered.  The string `{}' is replaced by the
              current file name being processed everywhere it occurs in the arguments to the command, not just in argu‐
              ments  where  it is alone, as in some versions of ffiinndd.  Both of these constructions might need to be es‐
              caped (with a `\') or quoted to protect them from expansion by the shell.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS  section  for
              examples  of  the use of the --eexxeecc option.  The specified command is run once for each matched file.  The
              command is executed in the starting directory.  There are unavoidable security problems  surrounding  use
              of the --eexxeecc action; you should use the --eexxeeccddiirr option instead.

       -exec _c_o_m_m_a_n_d {} +
              This  variant  of the --eexxeecc action runs the specified command on the selected files, but the command line
              is built by appending each selected file name at the end; the total number of invocations of the  command
              will  be much less than the number of matched files.  The command line is built in much the same way that
              xxaarrggss builds its command lines.  Only one instance of `{}' is allowed within the command, and it must ap‐
              pear  at the end, immediately before the `+'; it needs to be escaped (with a `\') or quoted to protect it
              from interpretation by the shell.  The command is executed in the starting directory.  If any  invocation
              with  the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then ffiinndd returns a non-zero exit status.  If
              ffiinndd encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit, so some pending commands may not be
              run  at all.  For this reason --eexxeecc _m_y_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d ...... {{}} ++ --qquuiitt may not result in _m_y_-_c_o_m_m_a_n_d actually being
              run.  This variant of --eexxeecc always returns true.

       -execdir _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;

       -execdir _c_o_m_m_a_n_d {} +
              Like --eexxeecc, but the specified command is run from the subdirectory containing the matched file, which  is
              not  normally the directory in which you started ffiinndd.  As with -exec, the {} should be quoted if find is
              being invoked from a shell.  This a much more secure method for invoking commands, as it avoids race con‐
              ditions  during  resolution of the paths to the matched files.  As with the --eexxeecc action, the `+' form of
              --eexxeeccddiirr will build a command line to process more than one matched file, but  any  given  invocation  of
              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d  will  only list files that exist in the same subdirectory.  If you use this option, you must en‐
              sure that your $$PPAATTHH environment variable does not reference `.'; otherwise, an attacker can run any com‐
              mands  they  like  by  leaving an appropriately-named file in a directory in which you will run --eexxeeccddiirr.
              The same applies to having entries in $$PPAATTHH which are empty or which are not  absolute  directory  names.
              If any invocation with the `+' form returns a non-zero value as exit status, then ffiinndd returns a non-zero
              exit status.  If ffiinndd encounters an error, this can sometimes cause an immediate exit,  so  some  pending
              commands  may  not  be run at all.  The result of the action depends on whether the ++ or the ;; variant is
              being used; --eexxeeccddiirr _c_o_m_m_a_n_d {{}} ++ always returns true, while --eexxeeccddiirr _c_o_m_m_a_n_d {{}} ;; returns true  only  if
              _c_o_m_m_a_n_d returns 0.

       -fls _f_i_l_e
              True;  like --llss but write to _f_i_l_e like --ffpprriinntt.  The output file is always created, even if the predicate
              is never matched.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information  about  how  unusual  characters  in
              filenames are handled.

       -fprint _f_i_l_e
              True;  print  the full file name into file _f_i_l_e.  If _f_i_l_e does not exist when ffiinndd is run, it is created;
              if it does exist, it is truncated.  The file names _/_d_e_v_/_s_t_d_o_u_t and  _/_d_e_v_/_s_t_d_e_r_r  are  handled  specially;
              they  refer  to  the  standard output and standard error output, respectively.  The output file is always
              created, even if the predicate is never matched.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about
              how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -fprint0 _f_i_l_e
              True; like --pprriinntt00 but write to _f_i_l_e like --ffpprriinntt.  The output file is always created, even if the predi‐
              cate is never matched.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual characters in
              filenames are handled.

       -fprintf _f_i_l_e _f_o_r_m_a_t
              True; like --pprriinnttff but write to _f_i_l_e like --ffpprriinntt.  The output file is always created, even if the predi‐
              cate is never matched.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual characters in
              filenames are handled.

       -ls    True;  list current file in llss --ddiillss format on standard output.  The block counts are of 1 KB blocks, un‐
              less the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are  used.   See  the
              UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -ok _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Like  --eexxeecc  but  ask the user first.  If the user agrees, run the command.  Otherwise just return false.
              If the command is run, its standard input is redirected from _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.

              The response to the prompt is matched against a pair of regular expressions to determine if it is an  af‐
              firmative or negative response.  This regular expression is obtained from the system if the `POSIXLY_COR‐
              RECT' environment variable is set, or otherwise from ffiinndd's message translations.  If the system  has  no
              suitable definition, ffiinndd's own definition will be used.  In either case, the interpretation of the regu‐
              lar expression itself will be affected by the environment variables 'LC_CTYPE'  (character  classes)  and
              'LC_COLLATE' (character ranges and equivalence classes).

       -okdir _c_o_m_m_a_n_d ;
              Like --eexxeeccddiirr but ask the user first in the same way as for --ookk.  If the user does not agree, just return
              false.  If the command is run, its standard input is redirected from _/_d_e_v_/_n_u_l_l.

       -print True; print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a newline.  If you are piping the out‐
              put  of  ffiinndd  into  another  program  and there is the faintest possibility that the files which you are
              searching for might contain a newline, then you should seriously consider using the  --pprriinntt00  option  in‐
              stead of --pprriinntt.  See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual characters in file‐
              names are handled.

       -print0
              True; print the full file name on the standard output, followed by a null character (instead of the  new‐
              line  character  that --pprriinntt uses).  This allows file names that contain newlines or other types of white
              space to be correctly interpreted by programs that process the ffiinndd output.  This option  corresponds  to
              the --00 option of xxaarrggss.

       -printf _f_o_r_m_a_t
              True; print _f_o_r_m_a_t on the standard output, interpreting `\' escapes and `%' directives.  Field widths and
              precisions can be specified as with the pprriinnttff(3) C function.  Please note that many of  the  fields  are
              printed  as  %s  rather  than %d, and this may mean that flags don't work as you might expect.  This also
              means that the `-' flag does work (it forces fields to be left-aligned).  Unlike --pprriinntt, --pprriinnttff does not
              add a newline at the end of the string.  The escapes and directives are:

              \a     Alarm bell.

              \b     Backspace.

              \c     Stop printing from this format immediately and flush the output.

              \f     Form feed.

              \n     Newline.

              \r     Carriage return.

              \t     Horizontal tab.

              \v     Vertical tab.

              \0     ASCII NUL.

              \\     A literal backslash (`\').

              \NNN   The character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).

              A  `\'  character  followed  by any other character is treated as an ordinary character, so they both are
              printed.

              %%     A literal percent sign.

              %a     File's last access time in the format returned by the C ccttiimmee(3) function.

              %A_k    File's last access time in the format specified by _k, which is either `@' or a directive for the C
                     ssttrrffttiimmee(3)  function.   The  following shows an incomplete list of possible values for _k.  Please
                     refer to the documentation of ssttrrffttiimmee(3) for the full list.  Some of the conversion specification
                     characters  might not be available on all systems, due to differences in the implementation of the
                     ssttrrffttiimmee(3) library function.

              %b     The amount of disk space used for this file in 512-byte blocks.  Since disk space is allocated  in
                     multiples  of  the  filesystem  block size this is usually greater than %s/512, but it can also be
                     smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %c     File's last status change time in the format returned by the C ccttiimmee(3) function.

              %C_k    File's last status change time in the format specified by _k, which is the same as for %A.

              %d     File's depth in the directory tree; 0 means the file is a starting-point.

              %D     The device number on which the file exists (the st_dev field of struct stat), in decimal.

              %f     Print the basename; the file's name with any leading directories removed (only the last  element).
                     For //, the result is `/'.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for an example.

              %F     Type of the filesystem the file is on; this value can be used for -fstype.

              %g     File's group name, or numeric group ID if the group has no name.

              %G     File's numeric group ID.

              %h     Dirname;  the Leading directories of the file's name (all but the last element).  If the file name
                     contains no slashes (since it is in the current directory) the %h specifier expands to  `.'.   For
                     files  which are themselves directories and contain a slash (including //), %h expands to the empty
                     string.  See the EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS section for an example.

              %H     Starting-point under which file was found.

              %i     File's inode number (in decimal).

              %k     The amount of disk space used for this file in 1 KB blocks.  Since disk space is allocated in mul‐
                     tiples  of  the  filesystem  block  size  this is usually greater than %s/1024, but it can also be
                     smaller if the file is a sparse file.

              %l     Object of symbolic link (empty string if file is not a symbolic link).

              %m     File's permission bits (in octal).  This option uses the `traditional' numbers which most Unix im‐
                     plementations use, but if your particular implementation uses an unusual ordering of octal permis‐
                     sions bits, you will see a difference between the actual value of the file's mode and  the  output
                     of  %m.   Normally you will want to have a leading zero on this number, and to do this, you should
                     use the ## flag (as in, for example, `%#m').

              %M     File's permissions (in symbolic form, as for llss).  This directive is supported in findutils  4.2.5
                     and later.

              %n     Number of hard links to file.

              %p     File's name.

              %P     File's name with the name of the starting-point under which it was found removed.

              %s     File's size in bytes.

              %S     File's  sparseness.   This  is calculated as (BLOCKSIZE*st_blocks / st_size).  The exact value you
                     will get for an ordinary file of a certain length is system-dependent.  However,  normally  sparse
                     files  will  have values less than 1.0, and files which use indirect blocks may have a value which
                     is greater than 1.0.  In general the number of blocks used by a file  is  file  system  dependent.
                     The  value  used for BLOCKSIZE is system-dependent, but is usually 512 bytes.  If the file size is
                     zero, the value printed is undefined.  On systems which  lack  support  for  st_blocks,  a  file's
                     sparseness is assumed to be 1.0.

              %t     File's last modification time in the format returned by the C ccttiimmee(3) function.

              %T_k    File's last modification time in the format specified by _k, which is the same as for %A.

              %u     File's user name, or numeric user ID if the user has no name.

              %U     File's numeric user ID.

              %y     File's type (like in llss --ll), U=unknown type (shouldn't happen)

              %Y     File's  type  (like  %y), plus follow symbolic links: `L'=loop, `N'=nonexistent, `?' for any other
                     error when determining the type of the target of a symbolic link.

              %Z     (SELinux only) file's security context.

              %{ %[ %(
                     Reserved for future use.

              A `%' character followed by any other character is discarded, but the other character is  printed  (don't
              rely  on  this, as further format characters may be introduced).  A `%' at the end of the format argument
              causes undefined behaviour since there is no following character.  In some locales, it may hide your door
              keys, while in others it may remove the final page from the novel you are reading.

              The  %m  and  %d  directives  support the ##, 00 and ++ flags, but the other directives do not, even if they
              print numbers.  Numeric directives that do not support these flags include GG, UU, bb, DD, kk and nn.  The  `-'
              format flag is supported and changes the alignment of a field from right-justified (which is the default)
              to left-justified.

              See the UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS section for information about how unusual characters in filenames are handled.

       -prune True; if the file is a directory, do not descend into it.  If --ddeepptthh is given, then --pprruunnee has no effect.
              Because  --ddeelleettee  implies  --ddeepptthh,  you cannot usefully use --pprruunnee and --ddeelleettee together.  For example, to
              skip the directory _s_r_c_/_e_m_a_c_s and all files and directories under it, and print the  names  of  the  other
              files found, do something like this:
                  find . -path ./src/emacs -prune -o -print

       -quit  Exit  immediately  (with  return value zero if no errors have occurred).  This is different to --pprruunnee be‐
              cause --pprruunnee only applies to the contents of pruned directories, while --qquuiitt simply makes ffiinndd stop imme‐
              diately.   No  child  processes  will  be  left  running.   Any  command  lines  which have been built by
              --eexxeecc ...... ++ or --eexxeeccddiirr ...... ++ are invoked before the program is exited.  After --qquuiitt is executed, no more
              files     specified     on     the     command     line     will     be    processed.     For    example,
              `ffiinndd _/_t_m_p_/_f_o_o _/_t_m_p_/_b_a_r --pprriinntt --qquuiitt` will print only `/tmp/foo`.
              One common use of --qquuiitt is to stop searching the file system once we have found what we want.  For  exam‐
              ple, if we want to find just a single file we can do this:
                  find / -name needle -print -quit

       Listed in order of decreasing precedence:

       ( _e_x_p_r )
              Force  precedence.   Since  parentheses  are  special to the shell, you will normally need to quote them.
              Many of the examples in this manual page use backslashes for this purpose: `\(...\)' instead of `(...)'.

       ! _e_x_p_r True if _e_x_p_r is false.  This character will also usually  need  protection  from  interpretation  by  the
              shell.

              Two  expressions  in  a row are taken to be joined with an implied --aa; _e_x_p_r_2 is not evaluated if _e_x_p_r_1 is
              false.

       _e_x_p_r_1 -a _e_x_p_r_2

       _e_x_p_r_1 -or _e_x_p_r_2
              Same as _e_x_p_r_1 --oo _e_x_p_r_2, but not POSIX compliant.

       _e_x_p_r_1 , _e_x_p_r_2
              List; both _e_x_p_r_1 and _e_x_p_r_2 are always evaluated.  The value of _e_x_p_r_1 is discarded; the value of the  list
              is  the  value  of  _e_x_p_r_2.  The comma operator can be useful for searching for several different types of
              thing, but traversing the filesystem hierarchy only once.  The --ffpprriinnttff action can be used  to  list  the
              various matched items into several different output files.

       Please  note  that --aa when specified implicitly (for example by two tests appearing without an explicit operator
       between them) or explicitly has higher precedence than --oo.  This means that ffiinndd .. --nnaammee aaffiillee  --oo  --nnaammee  bbffiillee

UUNNUUSSUUAALL FFIILLEENNAAMMEESS
       Many  of the actions of ffiinndd result in the printing of data which is under the control of other users.  This in‐
       cludes file names, sizes, modification times and so forth.  File names are a potential problem  since  they  can
       contain  any  character except `\0' and `/'.  Unusual characters in file names can do unexpected and often unde‐
       sirable things to your terminal (for example, changing the settings of your function keys  on  some  terminals).
       Unusual characters are handled differently by various actions, as described below.

       -print0, -fprint0
              Always print the exact filename, unchanged, even if the output is going to a terminal.

       -ls, -fls
              Unusual  characters  are always escaped.  White space, backslash, and double quote characters are printed
              using C-style escaping (for example `\f', `\"').  Other unusual characters are printed using an octal es‐
              cape.   Other printable characters (for --llss and --ffllss these are the characters between octal 041 and 0176)
              are printed as-is.

       -printf, -fprintf
              If the output is not going to a terminal, it is printed as-is.  Otherwise, the result  depends  on  which
              directive  is in use.  The directives %D, %F, %g, %G, %H, %Y, and %y expand to values which are not under
              control of files' owners, and so are printed as-is.  The directives %a, %b, %c, %d, %i, %k, %m,  %M,  %n,
              %s,  %t,  %u  and %U have values which are under the control of files' owners but which cannot be used to
              send arbitrary data to the terminal, and so these are printed as-is.  The directives %f, %h, %l,  %p  and
              %P  are  quoted.   This quoting is performed in the same way as for GNU llss.  This is not the same quoting
              mechanism as the one used for --llss and --ffllss.  If you are able to decide what format to use for the  output
              of  ffiinndd  then  it  is normally better to use `\0' as a terminator than to use newline, as file names can
              contain white space and newline characters.  The setting of the `LC_CTYPE' environment variable  is  used
              to determine which characters need to be quoted.

       -print, -fprint
              Quoting  is handled in the same way as for --pprriinnttff and --ffpprriinnttff.  If you are using ffiinndd in a script or in
              a situation where the matched files might have arbitrary names, you should consider using --pprriinntt00 instead
              of --pprriinntt.

       The --ookk and --ookkddiirr actions print the current filename as-is.  This may change in a future release.

SSTTAANNDDAARRDDSS CCOONNFFOORRMMAANNCCEE
       For closest compliance to the POSIX standard, you should set the POSIXLY_CORRECT environment variable.  The fol‐
       lowing options are specified in the POSIX standard (IEEE Std 1003.1-2008, 2016 Edition):

       --HH     This option is supported.

       --LL     This option is supported.

       --nnaammee  This option is supported, but POSIX conformance depends on the POSIX  conformance  of  the  system's  ffnn‐‐
              mmaattcchh(3)  library  function.   As of findutils-4.2.2, shell metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example)
              match a leading `.', because IEEE PASC interpretation 126 requires this.  This is a change from  previous
              versions of findutils.

       --ttyyppee  Supported.  POSIX specifies `b', `c', `d', `l', `p', `f' and `s'.  GNU find also supports `D', represent‐
              ing a Door, where the OS provides these.  Furthermore, GNU find allows multiple types to be specified  at
              once in a comma-separated list.

       --ookk    Supported.   Interpretation  of the response is according to the `yes' and `no' patterns selected by set‐
              ting the `LC_MESSAGES' environment variable.  When the `POSIXLY_CORRECT'  environment  variable  is  set,
              these patterns are taken system's definition of a positive (yes) or negative (no) response.  See the sys‐
              tem's documentation for nnll__llaannggiinnffoo(3), in particular YESEXPR and NOEXPR.  When `POSIXLY_CORRECT' is  not
              set, the patterns are instead taken from ffiinndd's own message catalogue.

       --nneewweerr Supported.   If  the file specified is a symbolic link, it is always dereferenced.  This is a change from
              previous behaviour, which used to take the relevant time from the symbolic link; see the HISTORY  section
              below.

       --ppeerrmm  Supported.   If  the  POSIXLY_CORRECT  environment  variable is not set, some mode arguments (for example
              +a+x) which are not valid in POSIX are supported for backward-compatibility.

       Other primaries
              The primaries --aattiimmee, --ccttiimmee, --ddeepptthh, --eexxeecc, --ggrroouupp,  --lliinnkkss,  --mmttiimmee,  --nnooggrroouupp,  --nnoouusseerr,  --ookk,  --ppaatthh,
              --pprriinntt, --pprruunnee, --ssiizzee, --uusseerr and --xxddeevv are all supported.

       The POSIX standard specifies parentheses `(', `)', negation `!' and the logical AND/OR operators --aa and --oo.

       All other options, predicates, expressions and so forth are extensions beyond the POSIX standard.  Many of these
       extensions are not unique to GNU find, however.

       The POSIX standard requires that ffiinndd detects loops:

              The ffiinndd utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously visited directory that is an
              ancestor  of  the last file encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, find shall write a diagnostic
              message to standard error and shall either recover its position in the hierarchy or terminate.

       GNU ffiinndd complies with these requirements.  The link count of directories which contain entries which  are  hard
       links  to an ancestor will often be lower than they otherwise should be.  This can mean that GNU find will some‐
       times optimise away the visiting of a subdirectory which is actually a link to an ancestor.  Since ffiinndd does not
       actually  enter such a subdirectory, it is allowed to avoid emitting a diagnostic message.  Although this behav‐
       iour may be somewhat confusing, it is unlikely that anybody actually depends on this behaviour.  If the leaf op‐
       timisation has been turned off with --nnoolleeaaff, the directory entry will always be examined and the diagnostic mes‐
       sage will be issued where it is appropriate.  Symbolic links cannot be used to create filesystem cycles as such,
       but if the --LL option or the --ffoollllooww option is in use, a diagnostic message is issued when ffiinndd encounters a loop
       of symbolic links.  As with loops containing hard links, the leaf optimisation will often mean that  ffiinndd  knows
       that it doesn't need to call _s_t_a_t_(_) or _c_h_d_i_r_(_) on the symbolic link, so this diagnostic is frequently not neces‐
       sary.

       The --dd option is supported for compatibility with various BSD systems, but you should  use  the  POSIX-compliant
       option --ddeepptthh instead.

       The  POSIXLY_CORRECT  environment  variable does not affect the behaviour of the --rreeggeexx or --iirreeggeexx tests because
       those tests aren't specified in the POSIX standard.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT VVAARRIIAABBLLEESS
       LANG   Provides a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null.

       LC_ALL If set to a non-empty string value, override the values of all the other internationalization variables.

       LC_COLLATE
              The POSIX standard specifies that this variable affects the pattern matching to be used for the --nnaammee op‐
              tion.  GNU find uses the ffnnmmaattcchh(3) library function, and so support for `LC_COLLATE' depends on the sys‐
              tem library.  This variable also affects the interpretation of the response to --ookk;  while  the  `LC_MES‐
              SAGES'  variable  selects the actual pattern used to interpret the response to --ookk, the interpretation of
              any bracket expressions in the pattern will be affected by `LC_COLLATE'.

       LC_CTYPE
              This variable affects the treatment of character classes used in regular expressions and  also  with  the
              --nnaammee  test,  if  the system's ffnnmmaattcchh(3) library function supports this.  This variable also affects the
              interpretation of any character classes in the regular expressions used to interpret the response to  the
              prompt  issued by --ookk.  The `LC_CTYPE' environment variable will also affect which characters are consid‐
              ered to be unprintable when filenames are printed; see the section UNUSUAL FILENAMES.

       LC_MESSAGES
              Determines the locale to be used for internationalised messages.  If  the  `POSIXLY_CORRECT'  environment
              variable  is  set,  this also determines the interpretation of the response to the prompt made by the --ookk
              action.

       NLSPATH
              Determines the location of the internationalisation message catalogues.

       PATH   Affects the directories which are searched to find the executables invoked by --eexxeecc,  --eexxeeccddiirr,  --ookk  and
              --ookkddiirr.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              Determines  the  block  size  used  by  --llss and --ffllss.  If PPOOSSIIXXLLYY__CCOORRRREECCTT is set, blocks are units of 512
              bytes.  Otherwise they are units of 1024 bytes.

              Setting this variable also turns off warning messages (that is,  implies  --nnoowwaarrnn)  by  default,  because
              POSIX  requires  that  apart  from the output for --ookk, all messages printed on stderr are diagnostics and
              must result in a non-zero exit status.

              When POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set, --ppeerrmm _+_z_z_z is treated just like --ppeerrmm _/_z_z_z if _+_z_z_z is not a  valid  sym‐
              bolic mode.  When POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, such constructs are treated as an error.

              When  POSIXLY_CORRECT  is set, the response to the prompt made by the --ookk action is interpreted according
              to the system's message catalogue, as opposed to according to ffiinndd's own message translations.

       TZ     Affects the time zone used for some of the time-related format directives of --pprriinnttff and --ffpprriinnttff.

              The --nnaammee test comes before the --ttyyppee test in order to avoid having to call ssttaatt((22)) on every file.

       Note  that  there is still a race between the time ffiinndd traverses the hierarchy printing the matching filenames,
       and the time the process executed by xxaarrggss works with that file.

              Notice that the braces are enclosed in single quote marks to protect them from  interpretation  as  shell
              script punctuation.  The semicolon is similarly protected by the use of a backslash, though single quotes
              could have been used in that case also.

       In many cases, one might prefer the ``--eexxeecc ...... ++`` or better the ``--eexxeeccddiirr ...... ++`` syntax for performance and  se‐

              This command works this way because the time since each file was last modified is divided by 24 hours and
              any remainder is discarded.  That means that to match --mmttiimmee 00, a file will have to have  a  modification
              in the past which is less than 24 hours ago.

                  $$ ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm 666644

              Files which meet these criteria but have other permissions bits set (for example if someone  can  execute
              the file) will not be matched.

       •      Search  for  files  which have read and write permission for their owner and group, and which other users
              can read, without regard to the presence of any extra permission bits (for example the executable bit).

                  $$ ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm --666644

              This will match a file which has mode _0_7_7_7, for example.

       •      Search for files which are writable by somebody (their owner, or their group, or anybody else).

                  $$ ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm //222222

              All three of these commands do the same thing, but the first one uses the  octal  representation  of  the
              file  mode,  and  the  other  two use the symbolic form.  The files don't have to be writable by both the
              owner and group to be matched; either will do.

       •      Search for files which are writable by both their owner and their group.

                  $$ ffiinndd .. --ppeerrmm --222200

              Both these commands do the same thing.

              These two commands both search for files that are readable for everybody (--ppeerrmm --444444 or --ppeerrmm --aa++rr), have
              at least one write bit set (--ppeerrmm //222222 or --ppeerrmm //aa++ww) but are not executable for anybody (!! --ppeerrmm //111111 or

              The  construct  --pprruunnee --oo \\(( ...... --pprriinntt00 \\)) is quite common.  The idea here is that the expression before
              --pprruunnee matches things which are to be pruned.  However, the --pprruunnee action itself  returns  true,  so  the
              following  --oo  ensures  that the right hand side is evaluated only for those directories which didn't get
              pruned (the contents of the pruned directories are not even visited, so their contents  are  irrelevant).
              The  expression  on the right hand side of the --oo is in parentheses only for clarity.  It emphasises that
              the --pprriinntt00 action takes place only for things that didn't have --pprruunnee applied to them.  Because the  de‐
              fault  `and'  condition  between  tests  binds  more tightly than --oo, this is the default anyway, but the
              parentheses help to show what is going on.

              In  this  example, --pprruunnee prevents unnecessary descent into directories that have already been discovered
              (for example we do not search _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_3_/_s_r_c because we already found _p_r_o_j_e_c_t_3_/_._s_v_n), but  ensures  sibling

       ffiinndd  exits  with status 0 if all files are processed successfully, greater than 0 if errors occur.  This is de‐
       liberately a very broad description, but if the return value is non-zero, you should not rely on the correctness
       of the results of ffiinndd.

       When  some  error occurs, ffiinndd may stop immediately, without completing all the actions specified.  For example,

       As  of  findutils-4.2.2,  shell  metacharacters (`*', `?' or `[]' for example) used in filename patterns match a
       leading `.', because IEEE POSIX interpretation 126 requires this.

       As of findutils-4.3.3, --ppeerrmm //000000 now matches all files instead of none.

       Nanosecond-resolution timestamps were implemented in findutils-4.3.3.

       As of findutils-4.3.11, the --ddeelleettee action sets ffiinndd's exit status to a nonzero value when it  fails.   However,
       ffiinndd will not exit immediately.  Previously, ffiinndd's exit status was unaffected by the failure of --ddeelleettee.

   ““ppaatthhss mmuusstt pprreecceeddee eexxpprreessssiioonn”” eerrrroorr mmeessssaaggee

       find: paths must precede expression
       find: possible unquoted pattern after predicate `-name'?

       This happens when the shell could expand the pattern _*_._c to more than one file name existing in the current  di‐
       rectory, and passing the resulting file names in the command line to ffiinndd like this:
       ffiinndd .. --nnaammee ffrrccooddee..cc llooccaattee..cc wwoorrdd__iioo..cc --pprriinntt
       That  command is of course not going to work, because the --nnaammee predicate allows exactly only one pattern as ar‐
       gument.  Instead of doing things this way, you should enclose the pattern in quotes or escape the wildcard, thus
       allowing  ffiinndd  to  use  the  pattern with the wildcard during the search for file name matching instead of file
       names expanded by the parent shell:
       $$ ffiinndd .. --nnaammee ''**..cc'' --pprriinntt
       $$ ffiinndd .. --nnaammee \\**..cc --pprriinntt

BBUUGGSS
       There are security problems inherent in the behaviour that the POSIX standard specifies for ffiinndd,  which  there‐
       fore  cannot  be  fixed.   For example, the --eexxeecc action is inherently insecure, and --eexxeeccddiirr should be used in‐
       stead.

       The environment variable LLCC__CCOOLLLLAATTEE has no effect on the --ookk action.
